  - "desc": "The marid can breathe air and water."

    "name": "Elemental Demise"
  - "desc": "The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the\
      \ most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular\
      \ genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that\
      \ isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant\
      \ wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates\
      \ that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature\
      \ only once in that creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature\
      \ within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then\
      \ cast the [wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell on the creature's behalf\
      \ to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might\
      \ try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.\
      \ The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."

  - "desc": "The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide.\

      \ smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
