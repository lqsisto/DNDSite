      \ is +5."
    "name": "Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)"
  - "desc": "The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12).\
      \ She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\
      \n**At will:** [dancing lights](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dancing-lights.md), [minor\

  - "desc": "The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a\
      \ magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general\
      \ size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action\
      \ to end it or if she dies.\n\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold\
      \ up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth\
      \ skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature\
      \ must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20\
      \ Intelligence ([Investigation](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation))\
      \ check to discern that the hag is disguised."

      \ ends (as if [concentrating](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
      \ on a spell). While [invisible](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible),\
      \ she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only\
      \ by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is [invisible](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible)\
      \ with her."
    "name": "Invisible Passage"
"lair_actions":
  - "desc": "The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful\
      \ aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually\
      \ only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action\
      \ that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's\
      \ most powerful ability.\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties),\
      \ the hag can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but\
      \ can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Until initiative count\
      \ 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings,\
      \ and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.  \n- The hag targets any number\
      \ of doors and windows that she can see, causing each one to either open or\
      \ close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful\
      \ DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked,\
      \ or until she uses this lair action again to open them.  \n\nA powerful green\
      \ hag might have the following additional lair action:\n\n- The hag creates\
      \ an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in its own space. As long\
      \ as she can see her duplicate, the hag can move it a distance equal to her\
      \ walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on her turn (no action required).\
      \ The illusion has the same statistics as the hag but can't take actions or\
      \ reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick up and hold\
      \ real objects. The illusion seems real in every way but disappears if it takes\
      \ any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses it (no action\
      \ required) or can no longer see it. If the hag uses this lair action to create\
      \ a new duplicate, the previous one vanishes, dropping any real objects in its\
      \ possession.  "
    "name": ""
"regional_effects":
  - "desc": "Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the\
      \ home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair\
      \ of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional\
      \ effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of\
      \ the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the\
      \ hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away.\n\n\
      The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's\
      \ fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Birds,\
      \ rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to\
      \ the hag) are found in great profusion.  \n- Beasts that have an Intelligence\
      \ score of 2 or lower are [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.  \n\
      - Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in\
      \ trees.  \n\nA powerful green hag creates one or more of the following additional\
      \ regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:\n\n- Illusory duplicates of the\
      \ hag appear in random places at random times (but never more than one in any\
      \ given location). An illusory duplicate has no substance, but it looks, sounds,\
      \ and moves like the hag. The hag can sense when one or more creatures are within\
      \ 60 feet of her duplicate and can interact with them as if she were present\
      \ and standing in the duplicate's space. If the illusory duplicate takes any\
      \ damage, it disappears.  \n- The region takes twice as long as normal to traverse,\
      \ since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking\
      \ mud.  \n- Trees transform into [awakened trees](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/awakened-tree.md)\
      \ and attack when hostile intruders are near.  "
