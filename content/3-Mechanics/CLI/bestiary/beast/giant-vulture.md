# [Giant Vulture](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\beast/giant-vulture.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 329. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)*  

A giant vulture has advanced intelligence and a malevolent bent. Unlike its smaller kin, it will attack a wounded creature to hasten its end. Giant vultures have been known to haunt a thirsty, starving creature for days to enjoy its suffering.
